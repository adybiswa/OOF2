Without --force, if the module already exists, don't do anything.  If
the top CMakeLists.txt and/or README exist but the module doesn't,
don't replace them, but do install the module.

Create basic templates for creating all the different kinds of
properties, not just the nonlinear/nonconstant ones we have now.
Ie, sources, K, C, M moduli.
