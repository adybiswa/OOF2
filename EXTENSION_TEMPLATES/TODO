Rename copy_extension.py to "oof2_extension_setup.py".  Install it
into bin when OOF2 is installed.  It should know OOF2_PYTHON3_VERSION
and OOF2_SWIG_VERSION, and CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX from the OOF2 build.
Make oof2_extension_setup executable

Install the templates into <prefix>/share/oof2/templates.

oof2_extension_setup will create files in its current directory and
copy files from the share directory.

Files in share/oof2/templates:
   CMakeLists.txt
   template-name/
       CMakeLists.txt
       template-name.C
       template-name.h
       template-name.swg
       template-name.spy

In the directory where oof2_extension_setup is run, create:
  CMakeLists.txt
  README
  module/
     CMakeLists.txt
     module.C
     module.h
     module.swg
     module.spy
  build/

DON'T overwrite files in module if they already exist, because that
would overwrite the user's edits.  DO overwrite the top
CMakeLists.txt, because the Python or Swig version numbers might have
changed.  MAYBE clear build.

oof2_extension_setup.py should have an --overwrite option that forces it to
backup and overwrite the files in the module directory.
