See the included readme.pdf file for the details of Ramberg-Osgood elasticity.

INSTALLATION

First, make sure that OOF2 is built and installed.

 The extension source code and a setup.py script are located in the
ramberg-osgood directory of the OOFEXTENSIONS package. This code
requires SWIG version 1.1 build 883 in order to work. Unlike the OOF
distribution, it is not possible to skip running SWIG when building
this extension. If a functional OOF2 installation is present on the
system, and SWIG is available, it should be sufficient to cd to the
directory of the setup script, and run:

   python setup.py install --prefix=<oof-installation-target>

The installation target should be the same one that was used when
installing the main OOF program. If this target is not specified, it
defaults to /usr/local.

LOADING

Once installed, the property will not automatically be loaded into the
OOF software. To accomplish this, either start OOF2 with the --import
command line argument, like this:

   oof2 --import ramberg_osgood

or after itâ€™s started, open an OOF console (or run OOF in text mode) and type:

   import ramberg_osgood

The Ramberg-Osgood elasticity property should then appear in the list
of available properties under Mechanical and Elasticity in the
property pane on the OOF materials page.
