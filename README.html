<p>This is the README file for OOF2, version 2.3.3 or later.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-oof2">What is OOF2?</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof/">OOF2</a> is designed to help
materials scientists calculate macroscopic properties from images of
real or simulated microstructures. It reads an image, assigns material
properties to features in the image, and conducts virtual experiments to
determine the macroscopic properties of the microstructure.</p>
<p>The programs are written in C++ and Python and benefit from an
object-oriented design. The underlying numerical solutions rely on
finite element technology. Hence the name OOF, for object-oriented
finite element analysis.</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p>The executive summary of steps (to be typed in a terminal window)
is:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir oof2
cd oof2
tar -xzf /download_directory_name/oof2-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../oof2-&lt;version&gt;
make
sudo make install</code></pre>
<p>but please read the rest of this file before proceeding.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong, your system adminstrator may be able to help
you, or you can contact the oof developers at oof_manager@nist.gov. It’s
diagnostically useful to include all of the output from the installation
commands.</p>
<p>OOF2 has been built and tested on Ubuntu Linux and macOS 13
(Ventura). It ought to work on other varieties of Linux.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>A computer running a variant of the Unix operating system, including
Linux and Macintosh. OOF2 currently does <em>not</em> run on Microsoft
Windows, but ought to run inside a Linux virtual machine on Windows.</p>
<p>The following external programs and libraries must be present before
you can run OOF2. To compile OOF2 from sources, you will also require
the header files (“includes”) associated with these programs and
libraries. These are usually available as part of a “development”
version of the library software.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org">Python 3 (3.8 or later)</a></li>
<li>[Swig (4.0 or 4.1)] (https://www.swig.org)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Magick++/index.html">Magick++
(6.x, but not 7.x)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gtk.org/download/">gtk3 (3.22 or later)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyGObject/">pygobject (3.28 or
later)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cairographics.org/cairomm/">cairomm (1.12 or
later)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pango.gnome.org/">pango (1.40 or later)</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/pango/PangoCairo/">pangocairo
(1.40 or later)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof/oofcanvas">OOFCanvas (1.1 or
later)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the words “or later” do not include later major
versions. OOF2 will not work with gtk 4.x. It is recommended that you
use a package manager to install the prerequisites, rather than
compiling them yourself.</p>
<p>Macintosh users can install either native Quartz or X11 versions of
gtk3, cairo, and pango. If using X11, they will have to also install an
X11 server to run OOF2. But there seem to be some problems with gtk3 and
X11 on Macs, so Quartz is recommended.</p>
<p>You should also have the ability to run <em>lapack</em> and the
<em>blas</em> basic linear algebra subroutines. On macOS no special
libraries are required. On Linux and commercial Unix systems, they may
have to be installed, and you may require headers (sometimes provided as
part of a “-dev” package).</p>
<p>Detailed instructions for installing the OOF2 prerequisites on a
number of different operating systems can be found on the <a
href="http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof/oof2/prerequisites.html">OOF2
Prerequisites page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="installing-oof2">Installing OOF2</h2>
<p>Commands in the following steps should be typed into a terminal
window, after you have installed all the OOF2 prerequisites. In the
commands below, type everything after the initial “%” into a terminal
window.</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">0. Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Please read the <a href="#disclaimerlink">Disclaimer</a> at the end
of this file before proceeding.</p>
<h3 id="download">1. Download</h3>
<p>Download the latest OOF2 source distribution from the <a
href="http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof/oof2/">OOF2 website</a>. That will
create a file called something like oof2-2.3.0.tar.gz.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-working-directory-and-move-to-it">2. Create a working
directory and move to it</h3>
<p>In your home directory or some other convenient location, enter</p>
<pre><code>% mkdir oof2
% cd oof2</code></pre>
<h3 id="unpack">3. Unpack</h3>
<p>Unpack the .tar.gz file. The usual way is to run <code>tar -xf</code>
on the file you want to unpack. If the file is in your Downloads
directory, type</p>
<pre><code>% tar -xf ~/Downloads/oof2-2.3.0.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>This will create a subdirectory named <code>oof2-2.3.0</code> in the
oof2 directory (if you followed the instructions in step 2).</p>
<h3 id="set-pkg_config_path">4. Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH</h3>
<p>The OOF2 installation process uses the <code>pkg-config</code>
utility to gather information about its dependencies. The data for
OOFCanvas needs to be in a spot where <code>pkg-config</code> can find
it. Test it by running the command</p>
<pre><code>% pkg-config --modversion oofcanvas</code></pre>
<p>If <code>pkg-config</code> reports the correct OOFCanvas version
number, nothing needs to be done. If it says it can’t find oofcanvas,
set the environment variable <code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> to the
location of <code>oofcanvas.pc</code>. For example, if OOFCanvas was
installed into your home directory, the file will be in
<code>~/lib/pgkconfig</code>, and after you run</p>
<pre><code>% export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=~/lib/pkgconfig</code></pre>
<p><code>pgk-config</code> will be able to find it. (The syntax for
setting environment variables depends on what shell you’re using.)</p>
<h3 id="configure">5. Configure</h3>
<p>Create a build directory.</p>
<pre><code>% mkdir build
% cd build</code></pre>
<p>If you want to use the default settings, run <code>cmake</code>,
pointing it to the unpacked source directory:</p>
<pre><code>% cmake ../oof2-2.3.3</code></pre>
<p>but beware that this will cause OOF2 to be installed in a system
directory like <code>/usr</code> or <code>/usr/local</code>, where you
might not have permission to create files. It’s better to use
<code>ccmake</code>, which will let you edit settings:</p>
<pre><code>% ccmake ../oof2-2.3.3</code></pre>
<p>See https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ccmake.1.html for full
instructions on how to use ccmake. At a minimum</p>
<ul>
<li>Type <code>c</code> to do the initial configuration</li>
<li>Use the arrow keys to navigate to <code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code>,
which is where OOF2 will be installed.</li>
<li>Type <code>&lt;return&gt;</code>, edit the prefix, and type
<code>&lt;return&gt;</code> again. Set the prefix to a directory where
you can write files, such as your home directory. If you’re installing
into an Anaconda environment named <code>OOF2</code>, set
<code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> to
<code>~/Anaconda3/envs/OOF2</code>.</li>
<li>Similarly, change <code>OOF2_PYTHON_VERSION</code> to the version of
python3 that you have installed, and <code>OOF2_SWIG_VERSION</code> to
the version of swig4. Use the same values you used when installing
OOFCanvas.</li>
<li>If you are going to build OOF2 extension modules, set
<code>OOF2_DEV_INSTALL</code> to <code>ON</code>. This will install the
C++ headers and other useful files.</li>
<li>Type <code>c</code> to update the configuration.</li>
<li>Type <code>g</code> to generate the build scripts and exit.</li>
<li>If <code>g</code> wassn’t an option at the bottom of the screen in
the previous step and ccmake didn’t exit, the previous <code>c</code>
probably added new variables. Check their values and type <code>c</code>
again until the <code>g</code> appears, then type <code>g</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-and-install">6. Build and install</h3>
<p>Run</p>
<pre><code>% make install</code></pre>
<p>If your computer’s version of <code>make</code> can run parallel
jobs, you can build OOF2 faster by including the <code>-j</code>
option</p>
<pre><code>% make -j 10 install</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>10</code> by however many compilation processes you can
run simultaneously.</p>
<p>If you don’t have permission to create files in the installation
directory (possibly because you didn’t change
<code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> in step 3) you should run the build
and installation steps separately so that you can use superuser
privileges for installation:</p>
<pre><code>% make -j 10
% sudo make -j 10 install</code></pre>
<p>The installation procedure will create executable scripts called
<code>oof2</code>, <code>oof2-test</code>, and <code>oof2-guitest</code>
in <code>&lt;prefix&gt;/bin</code>, a bunch of shared libraries called
<code>liboof2*.so</code> or <code>liboof2*.dylib</code> in
<code>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib</code>, a directory called <code>oof2</code> in
<code>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/python3.x/site-packages</code> (where 3.x is
your python version number), and some example files in
<code>&lt;prefix&gt;/share/oof2/examples</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, if <code>OOF2_DEV_INSTALL</code> was set,
<code>oof2-extension-setup</code> will be installed in
<code>&lt;prefix&gt;/bin</code>, the OOF2 C++ headers and swig files
will be installed in <code>&lt;prefix&gt;/include/oof2</code>, and
templates used by <code>oof2-extension-setup</code> will be installed in
<code>&lt;prefix&gt;/share/oof2/templates</code>.</p>
<h3 id="set-environment-variables">6. Set environment variables</h3>
<p>If <code>&lt;prefix&gt;/bin</code> is not in your Unix command path,
you’ll need to add it to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable, or
create a symbolic link from a directory that is in your path (or start
OOF2 the hard way by by typing <code>&lt;prefix&gt;/bin/oof2</code>).
<code>&lt;prefix&gt;</code> is the value you gave to
<code>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</code> in ccmake. (Typing
<code>echo $PATH</code> will print the current value of your path. The
method for setting environment variables depends on which Unix shell
you’re using.)</p>
<p>On Linux, if <code>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib</code> is not in the list of
directories that the dynamic linker searches for libraries, you’ll have
to add it by setting the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment
variable. This should <em>not</em> be necessary on macOS.</p>
<h3 id="test">7. Test</h3>
<p>If you want to test the installation, run <code>oof2-test</code> and
<code>oof2-guitest</code>.</p>
<p><code>oof2-test</code> runs a variety of tests that don’t depend on
the GUI. It can take a long time to complete. <code>oof2-guitest</code>
runs GUI-dependent tests. It doesn’t takes as long but it can get
confused if you accidentally click or type in one of its windows, so
it’s best to just sit back and watch it run.</p>
<p>The test files are installed into
<code>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/python3.x/site-packages/oof2/TEST</code> and
<code>&lt;prefix&gt;/lib/python3.x/site-packages/oof2/TEST/GUI</code>.
Each of those directories has a <code>README</code> file that may be
helpful.</p>
<p>In version 2.3.x there is something wrong with the GUI testing
apparatus that makes a few of the tests fail erratically. If
<code>oof2-guitest</code> fails, you can tell it to keep trying the
tests (within reason) until they work, with</p>
<pre><code>% oof2-guitest --retries=20</code></pre>
<h2 id="uninstalling-oof2">Uninstalling OOF2</h2>
<p>Go to the build directory and run <code>make uninstall</code>. This
deletes all the installed files but unfortunately leaves empty
directories behind.</p>
<h1 id="running-oof2">Running OOF2</h1>
<p>At this point, you should have an executable file named
<code>oof2</code> in a <code>bin</code> directory in your execution
path. You can now simply type <code>oof2</code> at your shell prompt,
and OOF2 will start up.</p>
<p>If you get a message like <code>oof2: command not found</code>, try
opening a new terminal window – the old one doesn’t know that a new
command has been added.</p>
<p>OOF2 also has many command line options, and you can get a summary of
them by typing <code>oof2 --help</code>.</p>
<p>By default, OOF2 runs in graphics mode, opening a couple of windows
to get you started. If you don’t want this, you can use the
<code>--text</code> option to run it in command-line mode.</p>
<p>Be sure to read the <a
href="http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/~langer/oof2man/">OOF manual</a> and to
go through the tutorials provided in the OOF2 Help menu.</p>
<h1 id="reporting-bugs">Reporting Bugs</h1>
<p>If you encounter bugs in the program, please send e-mail to <a
href="mailto:oof_bugs@nist.gov">oof_bugs@nist.gov</a>. Include as much
information as possible – it is extremely difficult for us to fix a bug
if we can’t reproduce it. In particular, include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What version of OOF2 you’re using. Starting OOF with the
<code>-version</code> flag will print the version number.</p></li>
<li><p>What type of computer and what operating system you’re
using.</p></li>
<li><p>A complete description of the problem: what happened and what did
you do to make it happen?</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, an OOF2 script that reproduces the problem. A script
can be saved from the <code>File/Save/Python Log</code> menu item in the
main OOF2 window, or the <code>Save</code> button in the
<code>Quit</code> dialog box.</p>
<p>If OOF2 crashes before you get a chance to save a script, a script
will be saved automatically in the your operating system’s temp
directory, which is probably named <code>tmp</code>. Look for a file
named <code>oof2-abcdef.py</code> where <code>abcdef</code> is a random
string of characters. You can change the location of the temp directory
by setting the <code>OOFTMP</code> environment variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure to include any files that the script requires, such as
images or other scripts that it loads.</p></li>
