Is common/garbage.py still needed?

StockButton in gtkutils.py doesn't show images because Gtk.STOCK* is
deprecated.
https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk3-Stock-Items.html

The "table" arg to pixelinfo plug-ins needs to change to a Gtk.Grid.

In Grid, instead of passing xoptions to Grid.attach, use
  child.set_hexpand(bool)
  child.set_halign(Gtk.Align)
  https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gtk-3.0/enums.html#Gtk.Align
  Can also use widget.set_margin_left(), ..right(), ...top(),
  ..bottom()

Table.attach(left, right, top, bottom) is replaced by
Grid.attach(left, top, width, height)

Get rid of widgetFontSizes(), widgetCharSize(), and widgetDigitSize().
Use Gtk.Entry.set_width_chars()

Gtk.Separator doesn't seem to be visible in a Gtk.Grid.  Is this a
theme thing?

Don't use Gtk.Alignment.  Use Widget alignment and margin properties.

We need a way to pass alignment and other properties in through
Parameter.makeWidget().  Maybe just **kwargs.

Frame shadow types are determined by the theme.  The docs are unclear
if themes distinguish between different types other than NONE and
not-NONE.  Use frame.set_shadow_type(Gtk.ShadowType.IN)

Replace window.raise_() with
window.present_with_time(Gtk.get_current_event_time()). 

Search for gtk.STOCK and replace with named icons.  Button text needs
to be provided with labelstr.  gtk2 supplied it automatically.

Dialog.add_button(stock_icon, response) needs to be written out explicitly:
button = Gtk.Button()
button.add(StockButton('gtk-ok', labelstr='OK', align=Gtk.Align.CENTER))
dialog.add_action_widget(button, response)

TODO: Figure out how default buttons on dialogs work.  It has
something to do with
Widget.set_receives_default()
Widget.set_can_default()
Widget.grab_default()
Entry.set_activates_default()
See the TODO in parameterwidgets.py:ParameterDialog

pdf output can be done directly by Cairo.  No need for a pdf output
device.  No need for the whole OutputDevice hierarchy.
DONE

All AbstractImage subclasses need to use something other than
StringImage to create CanvasImage items.
DONE

Gdk.threads_enter() and Gdk.threads_leave() are deprecated.  Make all
calls from the main thread.
https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Gdk-3.0/functions.html#Gdk.threads_enter
Don't need inside_idle_callback.
DONE

Attempting to drag text from the Console window crashes the program.
CAN'T REPRODUCE

Simplify the DisplayLayer handling in the Graphics window, like it is
in OOF3D.
* Get rid of the LayerEditor window and LayerSets.
* Merge the Display class into GhostGfxWindow, which will keep a list
  of layers.
* Editing a layer entails replacing its CanvasItems,  No need to
  create a new CanvasLayer.
* Debug problems with CanvasLayer destruction after this is all set.
DONE

We are inconsistent about the spacing and format of the labels that
identify input and output fields.  Sometimes there are colons and
sometimes there are equals signs.  Sometimes there are spaces at the
end and sometimes there aren't.  We should probably use Gtk to add the
space, and not put it in the label text.

Typing illegal input into the LabelledSliders when parametrizing an
Orientation property doesn't disable the "OK" button. (This isn't a
gtk3 problem.  The gtk2 version does this too.  Slider values are
parsed and evaluated only when it's time to use them, so they're not
checked as they're typed.)
