Python files

Run "2to3 -nw -f all -f idioms <files>"

2to3 changes calls to xxxx.next() to next(xxxx), apparently assuming
that xxxx is a real python iterator object.  Check that that's really
the case.

Make FieldIterator classes real iterators. See
file:///Users/langer/html/python-3.7.12-docs-html/library/stdtypes.html#typeiter
Same for ElementIterator, etc.

Search for TODO PYTHON3 for more instances.

Find all swigged functions that take a list argument and allow them to
take an iterator instead.
Similarly convert lists returned from C++ to iterators.

Use proc=subprocess.run() instead of os.system(), subprocess.call(), or
subprocess.Popen().  Use kwarg capture_output=True if necessary, and
examine proc.stdout.  proc.stdout.decode() converts from bytes to string.

Any integer division operation that has been forced to operate on
floats by converting one of the integers doesn't need convert
anymore.  x/y doesn't truncate. x//y does.

__div__ is now __truediv__, __idiv__ is now __itruediv__, and __rdiv__
is now __rtruediv__.  These do x/y.  To do x//y, use __floordiv__,
etc.

All classes are new style classes.  Not necessary to use "object" as a
base class.

Use 't' and 'b' file mode flags when opening text and binary files.
Does common/IO/menuparser.py work properly on binary and/or unicode
files?  Does it have to?

list.sort() has different arguments. Instead of a (postional)
comparator function, it takes a (keyword) key function.
Check all sort() and sorted() calls to be sure the key arg is correct,
and the cmp arg is not used.
__cmp__() is no longer used for sorting.  Use __lt__, __eq__, __ne__,
__gt__, __le__, __ge__.  Comparision methods should return
NotImplemented if they can't compare with the given object.


Named parameters after *args in a function definition must be provided
with keyword arguments.

Some functions in the string module are now just string methods:
string.join([strings], joinchar) ==>  joinchar.join([strings])
string.find(source, target) ==> source.find(target)
string.split(source, div)  ==> source.split(div)
New stuff that might be useful:
set literals:  {1,2,3} and {x for x in y} are sets.

A bare * in a function parameter list means that there is no variable
length argument list but there are keyword parameters.

f-strings: New way to format strings
https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/
f"This sets x to {x}"  replaces {x} with the current value of the
variable x.

SWIG ISSUES

Python3 exceptions need to be derived from Exception or
BaseException.  Can SWIG4 do that for us?

------

Things I did that might have consequences:

Changed the "object" kwarg to "obj" in LabelTree and LabelTreeNode
__init__ methods.  Same for MeshQueryContainer.set,
SkeletonQueryContainer.set, SkeletonQueryContainer.finishQuery

-------

On ubuntu, install python-dev-is-python3 (?) It seems rude to require
users to do that, since it also aliases python to python3.  Perhaps
there's a way to tell cmake to use python3.
