OOF2 TODO

This file is for high-priority or long-range TODOs for which a comment
in the code is insufficient for some reason.

Add an OutputDestination that saves objects to a given Python array.

Upgrade to gtk+3 and use libcairo instead of libgnomecanvas.

Allow the Remove Material button in the Element Group operations pane
on the Skeleton Selection page to remove the material from an element
to which a material has been only implicitly assigned.  Currently,
attempting to do that raises a KeyError.

Floating periodic boundary conditions.  For example, a system with
thermal expansion and periodic boundary conditions should be able to
expand as a whole.

For Adam C.:
Material property outputs
    Orientation at a point
    C_ijkl in various reference frames
Multiple outputs in one file, from Analysis page, not scheduled output.
    eg, x y stress strain orientation, all in one row

PixelGroup buttons on MS page should be desensitized when MS is busy.
This is an issue now that AutoGroup operations can take a long time.
