OOF2 TODO

This file is for high-priority or long-range TODOs for which a comment
in the code is insufficient for some reason.

Add an OutputDestination that saves objects to a given Python array.

Upgrade to gtk+3 and use libcairo instead of libgnomecanvas.

Allow the Remove Material button in the Element Group operations pane
on the Skeleton Selection page to remove the material from an element
to which a material has been only implicitly assigned.  Currently,
attempting to do that raises a KeyError.
