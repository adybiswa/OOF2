# OOFCanvas summary

OOFCanvas is a replacement for libgnomecanvas, designed for use in
OOF2, but hopefully useful elsewhere. OOFCanvas is based on
[Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) and is compatible with gtk3.
It might eventually also be compatible with gtk+2.

OOF2 uses [libgnomecanvas](https://developer.gnome.org/libgnomecanvas/)
to display and interact with images and meshes.  But libgnomecanvas
requires gtk+2, and gtk+2 works only with python3, not python2, and
python2 is being phased out.  In order to upgrade OOF2 to python3, we
need to first upgrade it from gtk+2 to gtk+3, and to do that we need
to first replace libgnomecanvas.

The canvas is a drawing area that can display a variety of shapes,
including text. It can be scrolled, zoomed, and printed.  Items drawn
on the canvas can be selected with the mouse.

OOFCanvas is *not* a drop-in replacement for libgnomecanvas.  It's
also not a full-fledged gtk widget.  It's a set of classes that does
some of what libgnomecanvas did and uses gtk.

All of the code is in C++.  Wrappers for Python 2.7 have been
generated by an old version of SWIG.  Hopefully we've remembered to
distribute the SWIG output so that users don't need to run SWIG
themselves.

All the classes and functions described here are defined in the C++
`OOFCanvas` namespace.  For simplicity we haven't included it
explicitly in the discussion below. 

### Coordinate Systems

Objects drawn on the canvas are specified in physical units, which may
be anything convenient to the user.  The coordinate system is (x,y)
where x goes from left to right on the screen, and **y goes from
bottom to top**.   This is not the convention in many graphics
libraries, but is standard for physics.

The conversion from physical to pixel coordinates depends on the size
of the canvas and the current zoom factor, and determines the ppu
(pixels per unit).  The user should be able to use physical units and
not worry about ppu at all.

Some types of canvas items are naturally defined in terms of pixels,
however. OOFCanvas handles the scaling for these too.


## The Canvas Classes

Three kinds of Canvas objects are defined.

* `OffScreenCanvas is` the base class.  It can be used to make drawings
that will be printed or saved to a file, but not displayed.

* `Canvas `is derived from `OOFScreenCanvas` (via an intermediate abstract
`GUICanvasBase` class).  It creates a `Gtk.Layout` which can be used in
Gtk3 to put the `Canvas` in a GUI.  It calls user-provided callback
functions in response to mouse events.

* A slightly different Canvas class is available in Python.  It's
actually a C++ class called `PythonCanvas`, which is derived from
`GUICanvasBase` and renamed to `Canvas` when exported to Python.  The main
difference between the C++ and Python `Canvas` classes is that the
Python class expects callback functions to be Python methods, and the
`GtkLayout` is created in Python.

The pixel size of a `Canvas` or `PythonCanvas` is determined by the Gtk
window that it's part of.  The pixel size of an `OffScreenCanvas` is
only computed when it's saved as an image and the size of the image is
given.

## The CanvasLayer Class

Drawing is done by creating one or more `CanvasLayers` and adding
`CanvasItems` to them.  `CanvasLayers` can be shown, hidden, and
reordered, making it easy to change what's visible on the canvas.
Opaque items in higher layers obscure the items in lower layers.

`CanvasLayers` are created by calling `OffScreenCanvas::newLayer()` and
destroyed by calling either `CanvasLayer::destroy()` or
`OffScreenCanvas::deleteLayer()`.

The size of a layer in pixels is determined by the physical sizes of
the items being displayed, and the current `ppu`.

## The CanvasItem Classes

Everything drawn on a `Canvas` is an instance of a `CanvasItem` subclass.
Pointers to `CanvasItem`s are passed to `CanvasLayer::addItem`.  The
`CanvasLayer` will destroy its `CanvasItem`s when appropriate -- the user
should never destroy them explicitly. 

Each `CanvasItem` has a bunch of parameters that determine its position,
shape, color, and transparency.  Position parameters are always given
in physical units.  Some parameters, such as line widths, can be
interpreted in either physical or pixel units.  If the `CanvasItem` has
such a parameter, it will have a `setLineWidthInPixels` method (or the
equivalent).

Details of each `CanvasItem` subclass are given [somewhere
below](#canvasitems).

## Basic Usage

In C++

```C++
double ppu; // pixels per unit -- initialize to something sensible
// Create a Canvas
Canvas canvas(ppu);
// Get a pointer to the GtkLayout widget
GtkWidget *widget = canvas.gtk(); 

// Install the canvas in the gui.  For example, if it's going into
// a GtkFrame,
frame.add(widget)

// Create a canvas layer
CanvasLayer *layer = canvas.newLayer("layername");

// Add items to the layer
double x=1., y=2., radius=1.4;  // In physical units.
CanvasCircle *circle = new CanvasCircle(x, y, radius);
double w=2.;                    // In physical units, unless ...
circle->setLineWidthInPixels(); // ... setLineWidthInPixels is called.
circle->setLineWidth(w);
Color red(1., 0., 0., 0.5); // r, g, b, a, all in [0.0, 1.0]
circle.setFillColor(red);
layer->addItem(circle);

// Add more items if you want
...

// Draw the items to the canvas
canvas.draw();
```

The equivalent Python is virtually identical

```python
from OOFCANVAS import oofcanvas, oofcanvasgui
canvas = oofcanvasgui.Canvas(width=300, height=300, ppu=1.0,
                             vexpand=True, hexpand=True)
frame.add(canvas.layout)

layer = oofcanvas.CanvasLayer()

x = 1.
y = 2.
radius = 1.4
circle = CanvasCircle(x, y, radius)
circle.setLineWidthInPixels()
w = 2.
circle.setLineWidth(w)
red = oofcanvas.Color(1., 0, 0, 0.5)
circle.setFillColor(red)
layer.addItem(circle)

canvas.draw()
```

Calling `Canvas::draw` doesn't actually draw anything.  Instead, it
generates a Gtk event that causes `GUICanvasBase::drawHandler` to be
called from the Gtk main loop.

## Mouse 

Call `GUICanvasBase::setMouseCallback(MouseCallback callback, void *data)` to
install a mouse event handler.  `callback` will be called whenever a
mouse button is pressed or the mouse is moved.  The signature of the
callback function is

	typedef void (*MouseCallback)(const std::string &event, 
	                              double x, double y,
								  int button,
								  bool shift, bool ctrl,
								  void *data)

where `event` is either `up`, `down`, or `move`. `x` and `y` are the
position of the mouse event in physical coordinates. `button`
indicates which mouse button was pushed, and `shift` and `ctrl`
indicate whether the shift and control keys were pressed.  `data` is
the pointer that was passed to `setMouseCallback`.


To control how the callback is invoked when the mouse is moved, call
`Canvas::allowMotionEvents(value)`.  In C++, `value` is a
`MotionAllowed` enum, with the the choices 

* `MOTION_ALWAYS` (call the callback whenever the mouse moves), 
* `MOTION_MOUSEDOWN` (call the
callback only if a mouse button is pressed), or 
* `MOTION_NEVER` (don't call the callback for motion events).

In Python, `MOTION_ALWAYS` et al. are variables defined in the
OOFCanvas namespace.  The default is `MOTION_NEVER`.

To install a rubberband that will be displayed when the mouse is
moving, call `GUICanvasBase::setRubberBand(RubberBand*)` from the
callback for the mouse-down event.  The current position of the mouse
will be passed to the rubberband's `draw()` method whenever the mouse
is moved.  Various kinds of rubberbands are defined in `rubberband.h`.
To stop displaying the rubberband, pass `nullptr` (in C++) or `None`
(in Python) to `setRubberBand()`.  OOFCanvas does *not* take ownership
of the rubberband object.  The calling code must delete it when done
with it in C++ (if necessary) and make sure to retain a reference to
it in Python (when necessary).

Five classes of `RubberBand` are defined:

- `LineRubberBand` is a straight line from the mouse-down position to
  the current position.
  
- `RectangleRubberBand` is rectangle with one corner at the mouse-down
  position and the diagonally opposite corner at the current position.
  
- `CircleRubberBand` is a circle centered on the mouse-down position
  and passing through the current position.
  
- `EllipseRubberBand` is an ellipse that is fit into a rectangle, as
	in `RectangleRubberBand`.
	
- `SpiderRubberBand` is a set of line segments, starting a given
  points and ending at the current mouse position.  The start points
  are specified by calling `SpiderRubberBand::addPoints(list)`, where
  in C++, `list` is a `std::vector<double>*` containing
  x0,y0,x1,y1,etc. In Python, it's a list of objects with `x` and `y`
  attributes.

OOFCanvas does not handle selection of objects with the mouse, but it
does provide the position of a mouse click as part of the data passed
to the callback function.  Additionally, it is possible to get a list
of all `CanvasItem`s at a point with
`OffScreenCanvas::clickedItems(x,y)`, where `x` and `y` are doubles.

## Scrolling

A canvas can be scrolled in one of two ways.  It can be connected to
`GtkScrollBar`s or other widgets elsewhere in the GUI, and it can respond
to `scroll` events generated within the `GtkLayout`.

To connect to scroll bars, call `scrollbar.set_adjustment(adj)` (in
Python) or `gtk_range_set_adjustment(scrollbar, adj)` (in C++),
where `adj` is the `GtkAdjustment` returned by
`GUICanvasBase::getHAdjustment()` or `GUICanvasBase::getVAdjustment()`.

If the `GtkLayout` receives a scroll event, the mousehandler is called
with `event` set to `scroll`.  The `x` and `y` values are the changes
in position, and can be used to modify the adjustments of the scroll
bars:
```python
def mouseCB(eventtype, x, y, button, shift, ctrl, data):
	if eventtype == "scroll":
		sx = horizontalScrollBar.get_adjustment().get_value()
		horizontalScrollBar.get_adjustment().set_value(sx + x)
		...
```

### Canvas Item Subclasses {#canvasitems}

Here are the `CanvasItem` classes.

#### Abstract CanvasItem Subclasses

##### `CanvasShape`

This is an abstract base class for most other `CanvasItem` classes.
It defines the following methods:

* `void setLineWidth(double)`
* `void setLineWidthInPixels()`

	Indicates that line width should be interpreted as pixels,
	not physical units.

* `setLineColor(const Color&)`

	See `Color`, below.

* `setLineJoin(Cairo::LineJoin)`

	In C++, the argument is a member of the Cairo::LineJoin class.  In
	Python, it's `lineJoinMiter`, `1ineJoinRound`, or
	`lineJoinBevel`, which are defined in the OOFCanvas namespace.

* `setLineCap(Cairo::LineCap)`

	In C++, the argument is a member of the `Cairo::LineCap`
	class.  In Python, it's `lineCapButt`, `lineCapRound`, or
	`lineCapSquare`, which are defined in the OOFCanvas
	namespace. 

* `setDash(const std::vector<double>&, int offset)`

	The vector contains a pattern of  dash lengths, which are
	in physical units unless `setDashLengthInPixels()` is
	called.  The pattern repeats as necessary.  `offset`
	indicates where the pattern starts.

* `setDash(double)`

	Use a single dash length, which is in physical units,
	unless `setDashLengthInPixels()` is called.

* `setDashLengthInPixels()`

	Interpret the lengths in `setDash` in pixel units, not
	physical units.

* `setDashColor(const Color&)`

	Fill the spaces between dashes with the given color,
	instead of leaving them blank.
			
##### `CanvasFillableShape`

This abstract class in derived from `CanvasShape` and is used for
closed shapes that can be filled with a color.  It provides one
method:

* `setFillColor(const Color&)`

	Fill the shape with the given color.

#### Concrete CanvasItem Subclasses

##### `CanvasArrowhead`

An arrowhead can be placed on a `CanvasSegment`.  The
`CanvasArrowhead` class is *not* derived from `CanvasShape`.  Its
constructor is
	
* `CanvasArrowHead(const CanvasSegment *segment, double position, double width, double length, bool reversed)`
		
	`segment` is the `CanvasSegment` that the arrowhead will be drawn
	on. `width` and `length` are in physical units unless
	`CanvasArrowHead::setPixelSize()` is called.
	
	`position` ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, and determines where the tip of
	the arrow will appear on the segment.  A value of 0.0 puts the tip
	at the first point of the segment, and a value of 1.0 puts it at
	the second point.  The color of the arrowhead is the same as the
	line color of the `CanvasSegment`.

##### `CanvasCircle`

Derived from `CanvasFillableShape`.  Its constructor is
	
* `CanvasCircle(double centerx, double centery, double radius)`
	
	or
	
* `CanvasCircle(const Coord &center, double radius)`
	
The coordinates of the center and the radius are in physical
units.  To specify the radius in pixels, use [`CanvasDot`](#`CanvasDot`) instead.

##### `CanvasCurve`

A `CanvasCurve` is a set of line segments connected end to end.  It is
derived from `CanvasShape`, but not `CanvasFillableShape`.  It is
specified by listing the sequence of points joined by the segments.
Its constructors are
	
* `CanvasCurve()`

	Create an empty curve, containing no points.  This constructor
	must be used in Python.

* `CanvasCurve(int n)` 

	Create a curve with room reserved for `n` points, but don't
	actually create the points.

* `CanvasCurve(const std::vector<Coord> &points)`

	Create a curve with the given points.

Points can be added to a `CanvasCurve` in C++ via

* `CanvasCurve::addPoint(double x, double y)`
* `CanvasCurve::addPoint(const Coord&)`

or 

* `CanvasCurve::addPoints(const std::vector<Coord>*)`

or in Python via

* `CanvasCurve.addPoint(x, y)` 
* `CanvasCurve.addCoord(pt)`

	where `pt` is some kind of point object, with `pt[0]` being x and
    `pt[1]` being y.

or

* `CanvasCurve.addPoints(ptlist)`

	where `ptlist` is a list of point objects `pt`, where `pt[0]` is x and
    `pt[1]` is y.

`int CanvasCurve::size()` returns the number of points in the curve.

##### `CanvasDot`

Derived from `CanvasFillableShape`, a `CanvasDot` is a circle with a
fixed size in pixels.  Its line width is also always measured in
pixels.  The constructor is

* `CanvasDot(double cx, double cy, double radius)`

or

* `CanvasDot(const Coord &center, double radius)`


##### `CanvasEllipse`

Derived from `CanvasFillableShape`.  The constructor is

* `CanvasEllipse(double cx, double cy, double r0, double r1, double angle)`

or

* `CanvasEllipse(const Coord &c, const Coord &r, double angle)`

where `cx` and `cy`, or `c`, give the center in physical units.
`r0` and `r1`, or the components of `r`, are the radii in physical
units.  `r0` is the radius in the x direction before rotation.
The rotation angle in degrees is measured counterclockwise.
	
##### `CanvasImage`

`CanvasImage` can display a PNG file, or if compiled with the
[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) library, any format
that ImageMagick can read.  To enable ImageMagick, define
`OOFCANVAS_USE_IMAGEMAGICK` when building OOFCanvas.

The constructor creates an empty image:

* `CanvasImage(const Coord &position, const Coord &size, const ICooord &npixels)`

where `position` is the position of the lower left corner of the
image in physical coordinates, and `size` is its displayed size.
If `CanvasImage::setPixelSize()` is called, the size is
interpreted as a size in pixels, otherwise it's in physical units.

Since an empty image isn't very useful, `CanvasImage` includes some
static factory methods for creating `CanvasImage` objects.  For all of
these, `x` and `y` are the position of the lower left corner of the
image in physical units.  `width` and `height` are the displayed size,
which is in physical units unless `CanvasImage::setPixelSize()` is
called on the returned `CanvasImage`.

* Create a blank image

	```C++
	CanvasImage* CanvasImage::newBlankImage(
           double x, double y,
           int nx, int ny,
		   double width, double height,
		   double red, double green, double blue, double alpha)
   ```

	The image is filled with a single color, so it's not really
	blank. `nx` and `ny` are size of the image in pixels.  `red`,
	`green`, `blue`, and `alpha` are all between 0.0 and 1.0 and
	specify the color and transparency.

* Read a png file

	```C+++
	CanvasImage* CanvasImage::newFromPNGfile(
		   double x, double y,
		   const std::string& filename, double width, double height)
	```

	`x` and `y` are the position of the lower left corner of the image
	in physical coordinates, and `width` and `height` are its
	displayed size.
   
* Read any file format that ImageMagick can handle

	```C++
	CanvasImage* CanvasImage::newFromImageMagickFile(
		   double x, double y,
		   const std::string& filename,
		   double width, double height)
	```

	`x` and `y` are the position of the lower left corner of the image
	in physical coordinates, and `width` and `height` are its
	displayed size.

* Create a CanvasImage from ImageMagick data

	~~~C++
	CanvasImage* CanvasImage::newFromImageMagick(
		double x, double y,
		Magick::Image imagedata,
		double width, double height)
   ~~~

	Create a `CanvasImage` from image data that has already been read
	by [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php).  The data is
	copied from the ImageMagick structure.


`CanvasImage` provides the following useful methods:

* Set the style for drawing individual pixels

	`CanvasImage::setDrawIndividualPixels()`

	Cairo draws pixels as small fuzzy blobs, which may or may not be
    what you want, especially if you need to zoom in.  When examining
    data on the image pixel level (not the screen pixel level) it can
    be convenient to draw each pixel as a rectangle.  Call
    `setDrawIndividualPixels()` to switch to this mode.
	
* Examine individual pixels

	`Color CanvasImage::get(int x, int y) const;`
	
	This returns the color of the pixel at point (x,y) in the image.
	
* Modify individual pixels

	```C++
	CanvasImage::set(
		int x, int y, 
		double r, double b, double g);
	CanvasImage::set(
		int x, int y,
		double r, double b, double g, double alpha);
	CanvasImage::set(
		int x, int y,
		unsigned char r, unsigned char g, unsigned char b);
	CanvasImage::set(
		int x, int y, 
		unsigned char r, unsigned char g, unsigned char b, unsigned char alpha);
	```

	These methods allow you to set the RGBA values of the pixel at
    x,y.  The first two methods expect the color parameters to be
    between 0 and 1. If the alpha value is omitted it's assumed to be
    1.0.  The last two methods expect values between 0 and 255.
	
	If you need to make extensive modifications to an image, it's
    better to use some other tools first and then load the modified
    image into the `CanvasImage`.
	
* Set overall opacity

	`void CanvasImage::setOpacity(double alpha)`
	
	This sets the opacity for the entire image, used when it is copied
    to the `Canvas`.  It doesn't actually change any image data.


##### `CanvasPolygon`

A `CanvasPolygon` is a closed `CanvasCurve`, derived from
`CanvasFillableShape`.  It is specified by listing the corners of the
polygon, counterclockwise.  Its constructors are

* `CanvasPolygon()`

	Create an empty polygon, containing no points.  This constructor
    must be used in Python.
	
* `CanvasPolygon(int n)`

	Create a polygon with room for `n` points, but don't actually
    create the points.  Points must be added with `addPoints`.
	
* `CanvasPolygon(const std::vector<Coord>& points)`

	Create a polygon from the given vector of `Coords`.
	
To add points to a polygon, in C++ use either

* `CanvasPolygon::addPoint(double x, double y)`
* `CanvasPolygon::addPoint(const Coord&)`

or

* `CanvasPolygon::addPoints(const std::vector<Coord>*)`

In Python, use

* `CanvasPolygon.addPoint(x, y)`
* `CanvasPolygon.addCoord(pt)`

	where `pt` is some kind of point object, with `pt[0]` being x and
    `pt[1]` being y.

or

* `CanvasPolygon::addPoints(ptlist)`

	where `ptlist` is a list of point objects `pt`, where `pt[0]` is x and
    `pt[1]` is y.

##### `CanvasRectangle`

Derived from `CanvasFillableShape`.  The constructor is 

* `CanvasRectangle(double xmin, double xmax, double ymin, double ymax)`

or

* `CanvasRectangle(const Coord&, const Coord&)`

where the `Coord`s are any two opposite corners of the
rectangle.  The corners are given in physical units.  Only the
first constructor is available in Python.
			
##### `CanvasSegment`

A single line segment, derived from `CanvasShape`.  The
constructor is

* `CanvasSegment(double x0, double y0, double x1, double y1)`

or

* `CanvasSegment(const Coord &point0, const Coord &point1)`

The positions are given in physical units.  Only the first form of
the constructor is available in Python.
		
##### `CanvasSegments`

'CanvasSegments` is derived from `CanvasShape` and draws a set of
unconnected line segments all with the same color and width.

The constructors are

* `CanvasSegments()`
* `CanvasSegments(int n)`

	Allocates space for `n` segments, but doesn't create them.  Only
    available in C++.
	
To add segments to the object, in C++ use one of 

* `CanvasSegments::addSegment(double x0, double y0, double x1, double y1)`
  
	  The segment goes from `(x0, y0)` to `(x1, y1)`.
or

* `CanvasSegments::addSegment(const Coord &pt0, const Coord &p1)`

	The segment goes from `pt0` to `pt1`.
	
To add segments in Python, use

* `CanvasSegments.addSegment(x0, y0, x1, y1)`
  
	  with four numeric arguments
  
or 

* `CanvasSegments.addSegmentPoints(pt0, pt1)`

	where the arguments can be indexed, `pt0[0] = x`, _etc._

##### `CanvasText`

`CanvasText` displays text at an arbitrary position and orientation.
It is derived from `CanvasItem`.  The text is drawn by the
[Pango](https://pango.gnome.org/) library.

The constructor is

* `CanvasText(double x, double y, const std::string &text)`

where `(x,y)` is the position of the lower left corner of the text, in
physical units.

`CanvasText` methods include

* `CanvasText::setFillColor(const Color& color)`

	sets the color of the text.
	
* `CanvasText::setFont(const std::string &fontdesc, bool inPixels)`

	`fontdesc` is a string that will be passed to
    [`pango_font_description_from_string()`]
	(https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/type_func.FontDescription.from_string.html)
    to determine the font.  It includes a font family or families,
    style options, and size (for example, `"Times Bold 0.2"`).  The
    size is interpreted in pixels if `inPixels` is true and in
    physical units otherwise. The names of the installed font families
    are returned by the `list_fonts()` function.
	
* `CanvasText::rotate(angle)`

	rotates the text by the given angle, in degrees, about the left
    end of the text's baseline.  Positive angles are counterclockwise.

### Utility Types: Color, Coord, etc.

These classes are defined in the OOFCanvas namespace and are used for
some arguments and return values by the main OOFCanvas methods.

#### `Color`

Colors are stored as RGBA values, which are doubles between 0 and 1.

C++ Constructors:

* `Color()`

	Initializes to black.

* `Color(double r, double g, double b)`

	Alpha is 1 (opaque).
	
* `Color(double r, double g, double b, double a)`

The only Python constructor is

* `Color(r, g, b)`

To change the opacity of a Python color, use

* `Color Color::opacity(alpha)`

which returns a new `Color` with the given opacity.

Predefined constants are defined for `black`, `white`, `red`, `green`,
`blue`, `gray`, `yellow`, `magenta`, and `cyan`.

#### `Coord`

`Coord` is a position in physical space. It's not available in
Python.  Methods that return a position to Python simply return an
(x,y) tuple.  Python methods that take a position as an argument
accept any type that can be indexed: `point[0]` is x and `point[1]` is
y. 

The constructors are

* `Coord()`

	The origin.
	
* `Coord(double x, double y)`

The components can be accessed via the x and y data members or via
indexing.  `coord.x == coord[0]`.

Basic arithmetic, assignment, and equality operations are supported.

#### `Rectangle`

The `Rectangle` class is not the same as the `CanvasRectangle`.
`CanvasRectangle` is a `CanvasItem` that can be displayed. `Rectangle`
is just a region of space. It's used internally, and also returned by
`GUICanvasBase::visibleRegion()`.   Useful methods are

* `Rectangle::xmin()`
* `Rectangle::ymin()`
* `Rectangle::xmax()`
* `Rectangle::ymax()`

all of which return values in physical units.

## Appendix: Adding new CanvasItem subclasses

## Appendix: Internal Order of Operations

It shouldn't be necessary to understand this section in order to use
OOFCanvas.  It's here to help development.

Each `CanvasLayer` contains a `Cairo::ImageSurface` which contains a
bitmap of what's been drawn in the layer, a `Cairo::Context` which
controls drawing to surface, and a `Rectangle` which is the bounding box
(in physical coordinates) of all of the layer's `CanvasItems`. 

When a `CanvasItem` is added to a `CanvasLayer`, the layer is marked
"dirty" and the item is stored in the layer.  No drawing is done at
this point.

When all items have been added to the layers, calling
`GUICanvasBase::draw()` generates a draw event on the `GtkLayout`.  This
causes `GUICanvasBase::drawHandler()` to be called.  The argument to
drawHandler is the `Cairo::Context` for drawing to the `GtkLayout`'s
`Cairo::Surface`. 

`GUICanvasBase::drawHandler()` begins by computing the horizontal and
vertical offsets that will be used to keep the image centered in
the gtk window (if the image is smaller than the window) or at the
position determined by the scroll bars (if the image is larger than
the window).

Next, drawHandler calls `Canvas::setTransform()`, which computes the
matrix that converts from physical coordinates to bitmap coordinates
within the layer, given the ppu.  The `GtkLayout` is resized if
necessary so that it is large enough to accomodate the bounding boxes
of all of the layers, plus an optional margin (set by
`OffScreenCanvas::setMargin()`).  Note that a layer's bounding box, in
physical units, can depend on the ppu if the layer contains items with
sizes given in pixels.

What happens next depends on whether or not a rubberband is being
drawn.  If there is no rubberband, `GUICanvasBase::drawHandler` draws the
background color and then, for each layer from bottom to top, tells
the layer to draw all of its `CanvasItems`s to its own `Cairo::ImageSurface`
(`CanvasLayer::render()`), and copies the layer's surface to the
`GtkLayout`'s surface (`CanvasLayer::copyToCanvas()`) at the position
given by the scroll bars.  (`CanvasLayer::render()` only redraws its
items if any have changed since the last time they were drawn.)

If there is an active rubberband, on the first call to `drawHandler`
after the mouse button was  pressed all of the `CanvasLayer`s other
than the rubberband's layer are rendered to a separate
`Cairo::ImageSurface` called the `nonRubberBandBuffer`.  Then this
buffer is copied to the `GtkLayout` with the rubberband drawn on top
of it each time the rubberband changes.  The `nonRubberBandBuffer` is
updated first if any other layers have changed.
